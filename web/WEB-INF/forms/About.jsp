        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I am a BSc Computer Science graduate from the University of West England who takes a keen interest
            in andragogy, or the psychology of adult learning. I was born and raised in Suffolk, and
            in 2012 moved to Bristol to study for my Bachelors degree.

            I studied psychology, sociology and biology at A-Level at New Suffolk College prior to this, and maintain
            a keen interest in these subjects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> 
            My focus of attention is directed toward the use of creative technology
            to enhance learning, with especial regard to virtual reality and how the 
            visuospatial aspect of perception affects not only the rate at which we
            learn, but also the retension of information into the long term memory.
            I strive to improve my proficiency at the gamification of the subjects I 
            have learnt in order to disseminate my knowledge onto others in an engaging 
            and entertaining way.
        </p>

        <h2>Previous Work</h2> 
        <br> 
        <h3>AI - Genetic Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
            I have worked on placement during my degree with the University of
            West England's <a href="http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/et/research/aig">Artifical Intelligence Group</a>.
            During both my Bachelors and my placement there has been an emphasis on 
            meta-heuristic search algorithms, in particular Genetic Algorithms, in order to
            find solutions to difficult problems which otherwise would be insurmountable with
            conventional techniques.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~jsmith/">Prof Jim Smith</a>
            I have worked on the Interactive Parameter Adaptation Tool <a href="http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~pcalebso/ipatindex.html">IPAT</a>,
            enabling it as a web application and refactoring its design to allow problem specifications
            to be outlined in XML.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Chatbots</h3>
        <p>
            Other task designated to me was the design of an online chatbot which acted as a virtual assistant
            to guide users to pages of interest and answer questions about the UWE university. It had the
            additional functionality of being able to access blackboard content such as PowerPoint presentations
            to answer course related questions based on metadata tags. The chatbot unfortunately was not deployed
            but this gave me the understanding of how to work with Java based interpreters and AIML files which
            persisted the chatbots knowledge.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>
            The time spent during my degree was partly dedicated to enterprise systems development including
            the design of websites using Java servlets and JSP pages, which were repurposed to create this portfolio website.
            The technologies I have used are JDBC and entity classes, Apache Tomcat web containers, Javascript, AJAX,
            CSS and external calls to third party services.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            My interests outside of academia are music, martial arts and languages. I am self- taught on the piano and guitar
            and have been playing these since I was little. I am learning Polish as a second language and can speak very limited French.
            My plans are to complete my blackbelt in Korean Karate once I have settled in a financially secure job.
