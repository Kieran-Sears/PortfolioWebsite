        <h1>3D UML</h1>

        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
            One of the concepts I am developing as a prototype is the integration
            of UML into a virtual reality environment.
        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            The aim of this is to allow a more comprehensive overview of software
            systems in an environment which detaches the developer from their
            usual work environment to reduce the affect of fatigue. The idea of
            being able to interact with the abstracted components of the software
            in UML in 3D is also hypothesised to ease the comprehension of the software for
            developers and stakeholders alike.
        </p>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>
            When networked the software will allow for the simulated "face to face"
            collaboration of developers and transcend the geographical barriers which
            often hinder the design process which heavily depends on frequent
            and detailed communication (i.e. <a href='http://www.agilemanifesto.org/'>Agile Methodology</a>).
        </p>

        <br> <p>
            The requirements for the prototype are thereby 3 fold:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Develop a tranquil virtual reality environment which is aesthetically pleasing
                in which objects in the virtual world represent UML model elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow the integration of tools commonly associated with IDEs to
                assist the design process. (May include use of AI techniques)
            </li>
            <li>
                Network the prototype to allow simultaneous access and collaboration
                on given projects by multiple users.
            </li>
        </ol>
